So I believe that this club is all about problem solving.
Learning about how to code, tackling problems.
Integrating new features with our designed products.
Hackathons
Working alongside internet Of Things.
Make some products that make life a little bit easier. And some that might bring about a big change in how we live or carry out a certain job.

Looking forward to begin with the work. :)
